# Implementation of "With Anchors or Not: Fairness-aware Truss-based Community Search on Attributed Graphs"

This repository contains the implementation of the methods proposed in the paper **"With Anchors or Not: Fairness-aware Truss-based Community Search on Attributed Graphs"**. The code includes two main components: **FTCS** and **AFTCS**.

## Components  

1. **FTCS**  
   - Fairness-aware Truss-based Community Search (FTCS) focuses on finding communities while maintaining fairness constraints.  

2. **AFTCS**  
   - Anchor-based Fairness-aware Truss-based Community Search (AFTCS) incorporates anchor-based fairness considerations into the truss-based community search process.
